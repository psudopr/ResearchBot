# 5.0 AI Summarization

This document outlines the steps to create the AI summarization and analysis component.

## 5.1 AI Service

Create a file `app/services/ai_service.py` to handle the interaction with the AI service (e.g., Google's Gemini API).

```python
import google.generativeai as genai
from app.core.config import Config

# Configure the Gemini API
# genai.configure(api_key=Config.GEMINI_API_KEY)

# model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-pro')

def summarize_text(text: str, user_narrative: str, global_prompt: str) -> dict:
    """Summarizes the text using the AI service."""

    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation.
    # You will need to construct the prompt using the hierarchical
    # prompting structure (Global -> Company -> RSS).

    prompt = f"""Global Prompt: {global_prompt}

    User Narrative: {user_narrative}

    Article Text: {text}

    Please provide a three-tiered summary of the article text, taking into account the global prompt and the user narrative.

    The summary should be in the following format:
    - Summary Sentence: [A single compound sentence, no more than 30 words]
    - Summary Bullets: [No more than 6 bullet points]
    - Summary Narrative: [A narrative of up to 250 words that summarizes the article, the summary should be contrast against the supplied user narrative]
    """

    # response = model.generate_content(prompt)

    # This is a mock response for demonstration purposes.
    mock_response = {
        "summary_sentence": "This is a summary sentence.",
        "summary_bullets": [
            "This is a bullet point.",
            "This is another bullet point."
        ],
        "summary_narrative": "This is a summary narrative."
    }

    return mock_response

```

## 5.2 Integration

The AI service will be called by the main application logic after the web scraper has extracted the content from an article. The summarization results will then be stored in the database.
