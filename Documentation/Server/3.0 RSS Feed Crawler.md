# 3.0 RSS Feed Crawler

This document outlines the steps to create the RSS feed crawler.

## 3.1 Crawler Service

Create a file `app/services/rss_crawler.py` to handle the logic for crawling the RSS feeds.

```python
import feedparser

def crawl_rss_feed(feed_url: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Crawls an RSS feed and returns a list of entries."""
    feed = feedparser.parse(feed_url)
    return feed.entries
```

## 3.2 Integration with the Scheduler

The RSS crawler will be triggered by the task scheduler. The scheduler will iterate through the companies in the database, get their RSS feed URLs, and then call the `crawl_rss_feed` function for each URL.

The scheduler will then pass the crawled articles to the web scraper and content extractor.
