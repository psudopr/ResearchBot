# 5.0 Styling

This document provides recommendations for styling the React application.

## 5.1 CSS Framework

I recommend using a CSS framework like **Bootstrap** or **Material-UI** to quickly build a modern and responsive user interface. These frameworks provide a set of pre-built components and a grid system that will save you a lot of time and effort.

### 5.1.1 Bootstrap

To use Bootstrap, you can install it via npm:

```powershell
npm install bootstrap
```

Then, import the Bootstrap CSS in your `src/index.js` file:

```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

### 5.1.2 Material-UI

To use Material-UI, you can install it via npm:

```powershell
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## 5.2 CSS Modules

For component-specific styles, I recommend using **CSS Modules**. CSS Modules allow you to write CSS that is scoped to a specific component, which helps to avoid naming conflicts and makes your styles more maintainable.

Create React App has built-in support for CSS Modules. To use them, simply name your CSS files with the `.module.css` extension (e.g., `MyComponent.module.css`).
