# ResearchBot

ResearchBot is an automated workflow designed to provide sophisticated business and financial insights by crawling and analyzing Google Alerts RSS feeds. It features a locally-hosted web interface for managing monitored companies, configuring analysis parameters, and viewing multi-level summaries of news articles and financial data.

This project is divided into two main components:

1.  **Server (Backend):** A FastAPI application built with Python that handles data processing, API endpoints, authentication, and scheduled tasks.
2.  **Application (Frontend):** A React web application that provides the user interface for interacting with the ResearchBot.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the ResearchBot, you will need to configure both the server and the application components.

### Server Setup

For detailed instructions on setting up and running the backend server, please refer to the [Server README.md](Server/README.md).

### Application Setup

*(Instructions for setting up the frontend application will be provided in the `Application/README.md` once it is created.)*
